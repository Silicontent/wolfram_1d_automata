# Wolfram's CA in Godot
This project is an implementation of Wolfram's Elementary Cellular Automata in the first dimension. For more on the subject, click [here](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html).

Made in Godot 4.2.1, this project adds a basic version of the CA along with settings to change the cell size and ruleset. If you want to use any of the (probably terrible) code, feel free. This project is released under the MIT license.
Thank you for reading, and have a wonderful day!
